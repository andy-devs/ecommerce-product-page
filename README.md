## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
-   Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
-   Add items to the cart
-   View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

### Built with

-   HTML
-   SCSS
-   JavaScript
-   [Lightbox](https://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/) - JavaScript library that displays images and videos

### What I learned

I learned how to build a sidebar on mobile devices, build a cart with function to add and remove items in it. Although, I struggled with lightbox gallery and haven't done it properly.

### Continued development

I think I'll do another project with JavaScript or start learning Algorithms and Data Structures.
